# Live Test Results: AAM vs. DCL Functionality

**Test Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Environment:** AutonomOS Platform (Replit)  
**Test Scope:** AAM Schema Drift Detection + DCL Entity Mapping

---

## Part 1: AAM Schema Drift Test ✅ COMPLETE

### Test Scenario
- **File Modified:** `mock_sources/opportunities_salesforce.csv`
- **Schema Change:** Renamed column `amount` → `opportunity_amount`
- **Purpose:** Verify AAM's handling of unmapped fields and drift detection

### Test Execution
1. Modified CSV header to simulate schema drift
2. Triggered FileSource connector ingestion for Salesforce opportunities
3. Queried `canonical_streams` table to inspect how drift was handled

### Results

#### ✅ **SUCCESS - Drift Detected and Handled Gracefully**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Processed | 1 |
| Total Records | 5 |
| **Unknown Fields Count** | **15** (3 per record) |
| Data Loss | **None** |

#### Detailed Findings

**1. Unmapped Field Detection:**
- The renamed field `opportunity_amount` was correctly identified as unmapped
- All unmapped fields were preserved in the `extras` dictionary:
  - `opportunity_amount` (the renamed field)
  - `currency` 
  - `type`

**2. Canonical Schema Behavior:**
- The canonical `amount` field was set to `None` (expected, since source field changed)
- No validation errors - system gracefully degraded

**3. Sample Data Preserved:**
```json
{
  "opportunity_id": "SFDC-O-001",
  "name": "Q4 Enterprise License",
  "amount": null,  // Canonical field is null
  "extras": {
    "opportunity_amount": "250000",  // Original data preserved
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "New Business"
  }
}
```

### AAM Drift Detection Capabilities Observed

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Unmapped Field Detection** | ✅ Working | All 15 unmapped fields detected |
| **Data Preservation** | ✅ Working | All values stored in `extras` |
| **Graceful Degradation** | ✅ Working | No ingestion failures |
| **Drift Event Logging** | ⚠️ Partial | Preserved in DB, but no explicit "drift" event emitted |
| **Auto-Repair Agent** | ❌ Not Implemented | Would require LLM-based field matching |

### Observations

**What Works:**
1. ✅ AAM mapping registry correctly identifies unmapped fields
2. ✅ Unmapped data is preserved in `extras` dictionary (no data loss)
3. ✅ System continues to operate with degraded schema
4. ✅ All records successfully ingested despite schema mismatch

**What's Missing (Per replit.md Documentation):**
1. ❌ Explicit "drift" event emission for monitoring
2. ❌ Auto-repair agent that attempts LLM-powered field mapping
3. ❌ RAG-based semantic matching for renamed fields
4. ⚠️ Schema fingerprinting only implemented for Supabase/MongoDB, not FileSource

### Recommendations

1. **Drift Event Emission:** Add explicit drift events to event stream when `unknown_fields_count > 0`
2. **Auto-Repair Trigger:** Implement LLM agent to suggest mappings for renamed fields
3. **RAG Integration:** Use semantic similarity to match `opportunity_amount` → `amount`
4. **FileSource Drift Detection:** Extend `schema_observer.py` to support CSV schema fingerprinting

## Part 2: DCL Entity Mapping Test ⚠️ PARTIALLY TESTABLE

### Test Scenario
- **Goal:** Ingest same contact from two sources and verify DCL unification
- **Source 1:** FileSource (contacts_salesforce.csv)
- **Source 2:** Supabase connector (hypothetical)
- **Matching Key:** Email address `bill.j@example-corp.com`

### Current State

#### Database Status
| Materialized View | Record Count | Status |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| `materialized_accounts` | 11 | ✅ Active |
| `materialized_opportunities` | 24 | ✅ Active |
| `materialized_contacts` | 0 | ⚠️ No Data |

#### Table Schema
`materialized_contacts` table exists with 18 columns:
- Standard fields: `contact_id`, `account_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `title`
- Metadata: `source_system`, `source_connection_id`, `tenant_id`
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `synced_at`
- Flexible: `extras` (JSON for unmapped fields)

### Test Status: INCOMPLETE

**Reason:** No contact data has been processed through DCL yet.

**To Complete This Test:**
1. Add test contact records to `contacts_salesforce.csv`:
   ```csv
   contact_id,account_id,first_name,last_name,email,phone,title,...
   TEST-C-001,TEST-A-001,William,Johnson,bill.j@example-corp.com,+1-555-9999,VP Engineering,...
   ```

2. Add matching record via Supabase (if connector configured):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO contacts (name, email, ...) VALUES 
   ('Bill Johnson', 'bill.j@example-corp.com', ...)
   ```

3. Trigger DCL ingestion:
   ```bash
   POST /dcl/connect?sources=filesource,supabase&agents=data_mapper
   ```

4. Query materialized_contacts:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM materialized_contacts WHERE email = 'bill.j@example-corp.com';
   ```

5. **Expected Result:** 
   - Single unified record if DCL entity resolution works
   - Multiple records if deduplication hasn't run

### DCL Entity Mapping Capabilities (Documented vs. Implemented)

| Feature | Documentation | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Materialized Views** | ✅ Documented | ✅ Implemented | Tables exist with data |
| **AI-Powered Entity Mapping** | ✅ Documented | ✅ Implemented | Graph generation working |
| **Unified View Creation** | ✅ Documented | ✅ Implemented | 11 accounts, 24 opps |
| **Entity Deduplication** | ⚠️ Implied | ❓ Unknown | No contact data to test |
| **Cross-Source Matching** | ✅ Documented | ❓ Unknown | Requires multi-source test |

## System Architecture Insights

### AAM (Adaptive API Mesh) Flow
```
CSV File → FileSource Connector → Mapping Registry → Canonical Event → canonical_streams
                                        ↓
                              Unmapped fields → extras
```

### DCL (Data Connection Layer) Flow
```
canonical_streams → DCL Engine → Entity Mapping → Materialized Views
                                       ↓
                              PostgreSQL tables (queryable)
```

## Critical Findings

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **AAM Mapping Registry:** Correctly transforms source data to canonical format
2. **Unknown Field Handling:** Preserves unmapped data in `extras` (zero data loss)
3. **Materialized Views:** Successfully created and populated (accounts, opportunities)
4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Proper `tenant_id` scoping observed
5. **Pydantic Validation:** Strict typing enforced on canonical schemas

### ⚠️ Gaps Between Documentation and Implementation

1. **AAM Auto-Repair Agent:** Documented but not implemented
   - replit.md claims: "auto-repair agent with LLM-powered field mapping"
   - Reality: Unmapped fields go to `extras`, no auto-repair attempted

2. **Drift Event Emission:** Documented but not fully implemented
   - replit.md claims: "drift detection with schema fingerprinting"
   - Reality: Works for Supabase/MongoDB, not FileSource

3. **DCL Entity Deduplication:** Documented but untested
   - replit.md claims: "AI-powered entity mapping with unified views"
   - Reality: Cannot verify without multi-source contact data

4. **RAG Intelligence:** Documented but not observed
   - replit.md claims: "RAG intelligence for semantic matching"
   - Reality: No evidence of semantic field matching in drift test

## Recommendations for Production Readiness

### High Priority

1. **Implement AAM Auto-Repair:**
   ```python
   # When unknown_fields detected:
   if unknown_fields_count > 0:
       drift_event = emit_drift_event(source, entity, unknown_fields)
       auto_repair_agent.suggest_mappings(unknown_fields, canonical_schema)
   ```

2. **Extend Drift Detection to FileSource:**
   - Add CSV header fingerprinting to `schema_observer.py`
   - Store baseline schema fingerprints per source file
   - Detect column renames, additions, deletions

3. **Test DCL Entity Resolution:**
   - Ingest duplicate contacts from multiple sources
   - Verify deduplication based on email/name matching
   - Measure precision/recall of entity matching

### Medium Priority

4. **Add Drift Event Streaming:**
   - Emit `drift_detected` events to WebSocket/SSE streams
   - Include confidence scores and suggested mappings
   - Enable real-time monitoring dashboards

5. **RAG-Based Field Matching:**
   - Use sentence-transformers to compute semantic similarity
   - Match `opportunity_amount` → `amount` (similarity > 0.85)
   - Auto-suggest mapping updates to users

## Conclusion

### Part 1 (AAM): **PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**
- ✅ Core drift detection works (unmapped fields identified)
- ✅ Data preservation excellent (zero data loss)
- ⚠️ Auto-repair and advanced RAG features not implemented

### Part 2 (DCL): **INCONCLUSIVE - NEEDS DATA**
- ✅ Infrastructure works (materialized views operational)
- ❓ Entity resolution untested (no multi-source contact data)
- ✅ Architecture sound (proper table schema, tenant isolation)

### Overall System Health: **GOOD WITH GAPS**

The platform successfully handles schema drift gracefully and maintains data integrity. However, some advanced features documented in replit.md (auto-repair agent, RAG semantic matching) are not yet fully implemented. The DCL entity mapping capabilities look promising but require actual multi-source data to verify.
