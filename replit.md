# AutonomOS - Multi-Tenant AI Orchestration Platform

## Overview
AutonomOS is a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS backend system in Python for AI-driven task orchestration. It ensures complete data isolation between organizations, providing secure, scalable, and enterprise-grade task processing. The platform includes JWT authentication and comprehensive user management, serving as a foundational component for AI applications requiring isolated task execution for multiple clients. Its ambition is to enable advanced AI-powered data orchestration for diverse business needs and offers a DCL (Data Catalog Layer) engine for AI-driven data source connection, entity mapping, and unified view creation.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear, concise explanations and direct answers. I value iterative development with frequent, small updates. Please ask for my approval before implementing major architectural changes or significant feature additions. I prefer detailed explanations for complex concepts but require brevity for straightforward ones. Do not make changes to folder `Z` and file `Y`.

## System Architecture
AutonomOS is built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Python RQ, implementing a multi-tenant task orchestration platform.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- API documentation is provided via Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- The frontend features interactive DCL graph controls, data source and intelligence agent selection, and a real-time status panel.
- The UI includes a connection timer, a horizontal progress bar, and a reorganized right sidebar with narration, RAG Learning Engine, and Intelligence Review panels.
- Graph labels are themed with color-coded, pill-shaped labels and SVG icons for unified ontology fields, outlined styles for agent nodes, and type-specific outlined styles for source nodes.
- Mobile optimization includes responsive navigation with a hamburger menu, enlarged touch targets, a compact mobile top bar, and stacking for connections page.
- The DCL graph visualization is clean, minimalist, showing only boxes and edges, with vertical centering and flow (top to bottom).
- The AAM container visualizes iPaaS-style data flow from disparate sources through normalization to DCL mapping, with real-time connection monitoring and prominent data source logos.
- The DCL graph dynamically adjusts its height based on the number of nodes, scales to fit all content perfectly within the viewport, and removes clipping restrictions for full visibility.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with Argon2 hashing.
- **API:** FastAPI provides REST endpoints for user and task management with tenant-scoped data access and Pydantic validation.
- **Worker:** Python RQ handles asynchronous task processing, lifecycle management, error handling, and retries.
- **Data:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for persistence and tenant isolation; Redis for high-performance task queuing.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Achieved through `tenant_id` scoping for data isolation.
- **AOA Orchestration:** An embedded DCL engine handles AI-driven data source connection and mapping. AOA endpoints orchestrate DCL operations via async worker tasks.
- **Callback System:** Supports optional `callback_url` for event-driven workflows.
- **Task Lifecycle:** Tasks transition through `queued`, `in_progress`, `success`, and `failed` states.
- **Concurrency Control:** Redis-based distributed locking for safe concurrent DuckDB access.
- **Idempotent DCL Connections:** The `/dcl/connect` endpoint is idempotent, clearing and rebuilding DCL state.
- **LLM Service Abstraction:** A factory pattern (`llm_service.py`) supports multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI) with a user-selectable model on the frontend.
- **DCL Graph Architecture:** The backend owns the complete data structure hierarchy, emitting `source_parent` nodes with explicit metadata and typed edges (`hierarchy` or `dataflow`).
- **Sankey Layer Enforcement:** Node depths are manually assigned based on architectural type after initial D3-Sankey layout.
- **Data Lineage Search:** Consolidated within the Connections page, using sessionStorage for cross-page query passing.

**System Design Choices:**
- Core components: `main.py` (FastAPI), `worker.py` (RQ), `models.py` (SQLAlchemy), `schemas.py` (Pydantic), `crud.py`, `security.py`, `database.py`, `config.py`.
- DCL engine is located at `app/dcl_engine/` and mounted at `/dcl`.
- System orchestration via `start.sh`.
- Frontend is a React/TypeScript application built with Vite, deployed to `static/`.
- Automatic production mode detection (via `REDIS_URL`) defaults to heuristic-only mapping for speed.
- Enhanced CORS configuration automatically allows all Replit domains.
- `uvicorn[standard]` for WebSocket support.
- Graph visualization ensures clean 8px nodes, proper padding, and SVG ClipPath for bounding.
