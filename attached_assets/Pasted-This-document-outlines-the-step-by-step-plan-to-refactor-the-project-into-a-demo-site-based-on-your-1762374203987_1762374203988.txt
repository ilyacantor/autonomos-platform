This document outlines the step-by-step plan to refactor the project into a demo site, based on your instructions. It includes enhanced safety checks and technical notes to ensure a smooth transition, especially for sensitive components.Phase 1: Setup & Scaffolding (Safety First)Create New Page Files: Create the new, empty component files for the pages. For example:src/pages/OntologyPage.jsxsrc/pages/DiscoverPage.jsxsrc/pages/ConnectPage.jsxsrc/pages/OrchestrationPage.jsxUpdate Routing: In your main router file (e.g., App.jsx, main.jsx, or similar), add the new routes for these pages.Update Navigation:Locate your NavBar.jsx component (or equivalent).Update the navigation items to the new order: Control Center, Discover, Connect, Ontology, Orchestration, .Link these items to their new routes.Ensure the FAQ, Notifications Bell, Login, and Sign up buttons are in the correct final positions.Phase 2: Component Migration (Page by Page)A. New Discover Page (Good Starting Point)Recreate Static Layout: Using the provided screenshot as a firm visual reference, build the static layout for this page in DiscoverPage.jsx.Agent Note: Focus on the layout, colors, and static elements. Don't worry about functionality yet, as instructed.Add Text Content:Title: "AOS Discover"Subhead: "Autonomously fingerprints your entire tech stack. Catalogs 100s of apps, databases, and tools without manual configuration. Infers relationships instantly. Creates secure architectural views using metadata only."B. New Ontology Page (High-Risk Component)Move DCL Container (CRITICAL):Agent Note: This is the most sensitive step. The DCL graph likely has complex dependencies.1. Identify Dependencies: Before moving, go to the current Dashboard page. Find the DCL container and identify:All props being passed to it.Any local state (useState, useReducer) that it relies on for data, controls, or settings.Any React Context providers (MyContext.Provider) that it must be wrapped in.Any data-fetching logic (useEffect, data queries) that feeds it data.2. Move Logic with Component: Move the DCL container component and all its identified dependencies (state, context wrappers, data-fetching logic) from the Dashboard page to the new OntologyPage.jsx.3. Fix Imports: Update all necessary import paths in OntologyPage.jsx.Move Other Components:Move the "Narration box" component to OntologyPage.jsx.Move the "RAG Learning engine box" component to OntologyPage.jsx.Move all contents from the current Connections page (data sources, selection tool, trace data lineage) to OntologyPage.jsx.Move "Unified view" and "Data source universe" from the current Ontology tab to OntologyPage.jsx.Safety Check: Per your instructions, the "repair activity box" is not moved.C. New Connect Page (High-Complexity Merge)Agent Note: This page merges content from three different locations. You will need to carefully integrate these pieces into a coherent layout in ConnectPage.jsx.Move from Dashboard:Move the "3-floating-panes visual."Move the text from around top and bottom of the floating panes visual.Move the "real-time connection monitor."Move the text next to it ("three-layer architecture, etc").Move from AAM Monitor Page:Move all contents from the AAM Monitor page.Retain Structure: Re-create the "Overview" and "Connector Details" tabbed structure within ConnectPage.jsx.Merge: The new "Overview" tab should contain both the items from Step 1 (floating panes, monitor, etc.) and the original content from the AAM Monitor's "Overview" tab.Move from Live Flow Tab:Move all contents from the Live Flow tab into the ConnectPage.jsx. (Decide if this becomes a third tab or is integrated elsewhere).D. New Orchestration Page (Straightforward Move)Move AOA Section: Move the "Agentic Orchestration Architecture (AOA) section" (with the 5 boxes) from the old Dashboard page to OrchestrationPage.jsx.Move AOA at Scale: Move all components from the "Agentic Orchestration at Scale" section from the old Dashboard page to OrchestrationPage.jsx.Phase 3: The "Safe Archive" Agent Note: This phase is critical for safety. Instead of deleting, we will archive.Create Archive File: Create a new, temporary file named _component_archive.jsx in your src directory.Archive, Don't Delete: As you move components from old pages (Dashboard, Connections, AAM Monitor), cut and paste the original component code into _component_archive.jsx.Comment Out: In the original files, you can now safely delete the component's code or just comment it out, leaving a note.Example in Dashboard.jsx: // <DCLContainer /> // MOVED TO OntologyPage.jsxThis keeps the old pages functional (though emptier) during the transition and keeps your old code 100% safe and recoverable.Phase 4: Final Review & Cleanup (User-Driven)User Review: Control Center (check if this was the old Dashboard or needs its own content).Discover (check static layout).Connect (check merged components and tabs).Ontology (Critically test the DCL graph and its controls).Orchestration (check component layout).Final Deletion: Only after I approve all work and confirm functionality, you can proceed to:Delete the old page files (Dashboard.jsx, Connections.jsx, AAM Monitor.jsx, etc.).Delete the _component_archive.jsx file.
