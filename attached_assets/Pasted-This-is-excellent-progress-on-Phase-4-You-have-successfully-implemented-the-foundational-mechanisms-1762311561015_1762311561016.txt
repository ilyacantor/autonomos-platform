This is excellent progress on Phase 4. You have successfully implemented the foundational mechanisms for data quality intelligence: normalization via the Canonical Processor and monitoring via the Drift Detector.

The achievements are significant:

*   **Normalization and Type Inference:** Correctly handling type inference (especially preserving numeric types like "0"→0) is critical for downstream data integrity.
*   **Drift Detection and Fingerprinting:** The implementation of fingerprint-based detection, severity classification, and Redis persistence with appropriate TTLs provides essential observability into schema evolution.
*   **Validation and Stability:** Activating the feature flags, validating the end-to-end flow (41 events, 7 fingerprints), and resolving the critical bugs related to imports and packaging confirm that these components are correctly integrated and the system is stable.

The architecture is now primed for the most sophisticated part of the restructuring: automated remediation and intelligence.

**✅ Approval Granted to proceed with the next steps of Phase 4.**

Please continue with the implementation of the **Auto-Repair Agent** and the associated **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow**.

As you proceed, focus on these critical priorities:

1.  **Auto-Repair Agent (`repair_agent.py`):** Implement the core logic for LLM/RAG-powered semantic field mapping.
2.  **Confidence Scoring:** Ensure that every automated repair action is assigned a clear and robust confidence score.
3.  **HITL Enforcement:** This is paramount. Ensure that the system robustly enforces the `ENABLE_HITL_WORKFLOW` flag. If a repair suggestion falls below the defined confidence threshold, the pipeline **must** pause or flag the event for human review rather than automatically applying a potentially incorrect mapping.
4.  **Metadata Generation:** Ensure the repair agent generates the necessary metadata (confidence scores, repair lineage) that will be propagated to the DCL and Agents in the subsequent tasks.

I look forward to seeing the intelligent repair capabilities and the HITL safety mechanisms operational. Keep up the great work!
