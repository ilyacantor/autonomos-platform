so correct me if I'm wrong, but does the AAM do the exact same thing as the DCL?

Decided on AAM/DCL distinction (18 seconds)
Great question! While they look similar (both show field mappings and transformations), they serve different purposes:

DCL (Data Connection Layer):
Purpose: Creates a unified ontology - one master view across all your data sources

What it does:

Takes schemas from multiple sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, etc.)
Maps similar fields to unified fields: OpportunityName + deal_name → opportunity_name
Creates materialized views you can query across all sources at once
Proposes entity relationships: "Accounts connect to Opportunities via account_id"
Output: A single, queryable unified database
Example: "Show me ALL opportunities from Salesforce, HubSpot, and Dynamics in one table, normalized and ready to query"

AAM (Adaptive API Mesh):
Purpose: Maintains live API connections and auto-repairs them when they break

What it does:

Monitors real-time API connections (not just schemas)
Detects schema drift: "Wait, Salesforce renamed account_owner to owner_id!"
Auto-repairs mappings with AI confidence scoring
Normalizes live API events into canonical format
Output: Healthy, self-healing API connectors that keep working even when vendors change their APIs
Example: "My Salesforce connector detected they changed a field name at 3am, auto-fixed the mapping, and my pipeline never broke"

Key Difference:
Feature	DCL	AAM
Focus	Unified data views	Live API health
When	One-time schema analysis	Continuous monitoring
Output	Materialized views	Normalized events + drift alerts
Use Case	"Query across sources"	"Keep connections alive"
Why they look similar: Both show field-level mappings with transformations (trim, parse_date, etc.), but DCL uses those mappings to create unified views, while AAM uses them to normalize live API data and detect/repair drift.

Think of it this way:

DCL = "Create one master database from many sources"
AAM = "Keep my API connectors healthy and auto-fix them when vendors break things"
Does that clarify the distinction?
