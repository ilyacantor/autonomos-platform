You are the lead front-end engineer on the AutonomOS (AOS) platform.

Context:
- This Replit project is the main AOS app (React/Vite SPA + FastAPI backend).
- There is a separate AOS_Discovery_v2 (AOD) project that I do NOT want you to touch from here.
- For this task, DO NOT modify the DCL engine, AAM logic, or any existing core flows.
- This is a UI-only demo step: fake AOD, fake pipeline, everything local to the front-end.

Goal:
Create a new “Discovery → Connect” demo page inside the AOS React UI that visually looks like the existing AOS Discover (AOD) dashboard, but lives inside this app and uses static in-memory data.

High-level UX:
- Single-page “boring enterprise console”, route something like `/demo/discovery`.
- Top: summary of “assets” across 4 vendors.
- Middle: vendor cards.
- Vendor click: opens a modal showing asset rows (like the existing Salesforce Assets modal in AOD).
- Each asset row has a checkbox “Include in demo pipeline”.
- Bottom: a “Connect selected assets” section that shows a 4-stage pipeline status bar:
  1. AOD Discovery
  2. AAM Connections
  3. DCL Mapping
  4. Agent Execution
- For this first pass, the pipeline is simulated entirely on the client with timeouts.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change router/navigation structure in a breaking way. Add a new route/page and a simple nav link (e.g., “Discovery Demo”) in whatever nav pattern already exists.
- Keep styling consistent with current dark-theme AOS UI and the AOD screenshots: cards, chips, fonts, and color palette. Reuse existing components where possible instead of inventing new styling systems.
- NO network calls for this prompt. All data must live in a small mock file or constant.

Implementation details:

1) Create a typed model for “fake AOD assets”
   - In `src/` (or wherever models live), add something like `src/demo/aodMockData.ts` (or the closest equivalent path that fits the current structure).
   - Define types roughly like:

     type AssetState = 'READY_FOR_CONNECT' | 'PARKED' | 'UNKNOWN' | 'CONNECTED' | 'PROCESSING';
     type AssetKind = 'service' | 'db' | 'saas' | 'host';

     interface AodAsset {
       id: string;
       name: string;
       vendor: 'salesforce' | 'mongodb' | 'supabase' | 'legacy';
       kind: AssetKind;
       environment: 'prod' | 'staging' | 'dev';
       state: AssetState;
       ownerEmail: string;
     }

   - Export:
     - A small array of 20–40 assets across 4 vendors (salesforce, mongodb, supabase, legacy).
     - Derived helper functions:
       - getVendorSummary(assets): returns counts per vendor.
       - getTotalCounts(assets): total, ready, parked, etc.

   - Use realistic-looking data and emails but no PII.

2) New React page: DiscoveryDemoPage
   - Place the component in the appropriate folder for pages (e.g., `src/pages/DiscoveryDemoPage.tsx` or equivalent).
   - Layout:
     - Title: “AOS Discovery & Connection (Demo)”.
     - Sub-header text: “Simulated AOD asset catalog across 4 vendors (Salesforce, MongoDB, Supabase, Legacy Files)”.
   - Top row: 3–4 summary cards (reuse existing Card components if available):
     - Total Assets
     - Ready for Connect
     - Parked (HITL)
     - Shadow IT / High Risk (can just be a number derived from mock data or a fixed label).
   - Middle section: vendor list:
     - Either 4 cards or a table, but should look like AOD’s “Catalogued Inventory by Vendor”:
       - Each row/card: Vendor name + count of assets + a “View assets” button.
       - Clicking opens a modal (see next step).
   - Vendor modal:
     - Reuse or recreate a modal styled like the AOD “salesforce Assets” modal:
       - Columns: Asset Name, Kind, Vendor, Environment, State, Owner, and a final column “Include in demo pipeline” with a checkbox.
       - Show only assets for the selected vendor.
       - State is displayed as colored chips similar to AOD (READY_FOR_CONNECT = green, PARKED = orange, etc.).
       - Modal has Close button.
     - The “Include in demo pipeline” selection should be stored in React state so that when the modal closes/reopens, selections persist.

3) “Connect selected assets” demo pipeline (client-side only)
   - At the bottom of the page, show a pipeline block summarizing current selection:
     - Text: “You’ve selected X assets across Y vendors for the demo pipeline.”
     - Button: “Connect selected assets”.
   - When button is pressed:
     - If nothing is selected, show a non-blocking message (e.g., toast or inline warning): “Select at least one asset to connect”.
     - Otherwise, simulate pipeline progress entirely in the browser:
       - Maintain a small piece of state like:

         type StageStatus = 'idle' | 'running' | 'success';

         interface PipelineStatus {
           aodDiscovery: StageStatus;
           aamConnections: StageStatus;
           dclMapping: StageStatus;
           agentExecution: StageStatus;
         }

       - On click:
         - Set aodDiscovery to 'success' immediately (since AOD is simulated by the mock assets).
         - Then, with setTimeouts (e.g., 800ms apart), move aamConnections → running → success, then dclMapping, then agentExecution.
       - Show these 4 stages as horizontally aligned cards or stepper, with:
         - Stage name
         - Short description
           - Example:
             - AOD Discovery: “Static asset catalog (fake AOD).”
             - AAM Connections: “Simulating connector activation for selected vendors.”
             - DCL Mapping: “Simulating unified view creation (customer_360).”
             - Agent Execution: “Simulating a simple cross-source query.”
         - Visual status: idle = grey, running = spinner, success = green check.

4) Routing & navigation
   - Integrate the new page into the existing router:
     - Expose it at a clean path, e.g. `/demo/discovery` or `/console/discovery-demo`, matching current conventions.
   - Add a single nav link in the existing layout to reach this page.
     - Label: “Discovery Demo” (or “AOS Demo: Discovery → Connect”).
   - Ensure this page does NOT become the default landing page; it’s a demo corner.

5) Safeguards / non-goals
   - Do NOT:
     - Change or remove existing routes.
     - Touch DCL or AAM code, including DCL graph visualizer or flow monitor.
     - Wire this to any backend API for now.
   - Keep all changes additive and easy to revert:
     - New files under a `demo` or similar namespace.
     - Minimal, localized updates to nav/routing.

6) Validation
   - Run the app and verify:
     - The new route builds without TypeScript errors.
     - Summary cards render with counts derived from the mock data.
     - Clicking a vendor opens the modal with vendor-specific assets.
     - Checkboxes persist while navigating between vendors and reopening the modal.
     - Clicking “Connect selected assets” animates the 4-stage pipeline statuses with no network.

Please show me:
- The file tree locations you created/modified.
- The core React code for the new page and the mock data file.
- Any changes to routing/nav.
- Screenshots or a short description of the final UX.
