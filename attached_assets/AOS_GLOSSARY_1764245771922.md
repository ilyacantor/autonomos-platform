# AutonomOS / AOS – Canonical Glossary (v1)

## 0. Big Picture

**AutonomOS (AOS)**  
An AI-native "operating system" for the enterprise data/agent stack.

It sits between chaotic source systems and domain agents and does three things:

1. **Discover & classify** everything that runs in your estate (**AOD**).
2. **Connect & normalize** business data into a canonical ontology (**AAM + DCL**).
3. **Feed agents & humans** clean, persona-specific streams of information (FinOps, RevOps, etc.).

In the AI Startup Ecosystem graphics, AOS is the **data + orchestration spine** that connects infra/data platforms at the bottom to domain copilots/agents at the top.

## 1. Core Platform Components

### 1.1 AOD – Asset & Observability Discovery (AOS Discover)

**What it is**  
Component that **discovers, catalogs, and scores** everything running in the environment.  
Answering: "What assets do we have, where are they, and how risky/important are they?"

**Key responsibilities**

- Ingests infrastructure and SaaS telemetry (logs, configs, IdP, cloud APIs, etc.).
- Builds and maintains the **Asset Graph** (hosts, DBs, apps, SaaS tenants, queues, etc.).
- Flags **shadow IT**, risky assets, anomalies, and policy vs reality mismatches.
- Provides input into:
  - **AAM** – which connectors to enable.
  - **DCL** – which systems may be Sources of business entities.
  - **Agents** – context for risk, blast radius, cost, etc.

---

### 1.2 AAM – Adaptive API Mesh

**What it is**  
The **connection and auth layer** between AOS and external systems (APIs, DBs, SaaS).  
Abstracts away OAuth, IdP integration, secrets, per-system quirks, and rate limits.

**Key responsibilities**

- Manages **connectors** (Salesforce, NetSuite, Stripe, SAP, Snowflake, Postgres, etc.).
- Mediates **authentication & authorization** via IdP and/or secrets managers.
- Normalizes access patterns into a unified interface for:
  - "Read entities"
  - "Read events"
  - "Write back"
- Exposes a **uniform API** (RPC/HTTP/GraphQL, etc.) to DCL, AOD, and Agents so they don't each need to know how to talk to individual systems.

---

### 1.3 DCL – Data Connectivity Layer

**What it is**  
The **unification and ontology engine** for business data.  
Converts heterogeneous schemas from many systems into a **canonical set of entities**.

**Key responsibilities**

- Maintains the **ontology** (Account, Opportunity, Revenue, Cost, Usage, etc.).
- For each entity:
  - Identifies relevant **Sources** (systems-of-record, DW tables, etc.).
  - Maps source fields to canonical fields.
  - Performs **entity resolution** (e.g., same customer across Salesforce, NetSuite, DW).
- Produces **canonical streams** of entities that are:
  - Clean
  - De-duplicated
  - Linked across systems
- Serves those streams to:
  - Domain agents (FinOps, RevOps, SecOps, etc.).
  - Persona dashboards (CFO, CRO, COO, CTO).

---

### 1.4 Agent Layer (Domain Agents)

**What it is**  
A family of **domain-specific agents** that consume canonical data and act:

- FinOps Agent
- RevOps Agent
- SecOps/Risk Agent
- Ops/Usage Agent
- Others as needed

**Key responsibilities**

- Operate on top of **DCL's canonical streams**, not raw sources.
- Combine:
  - Domain rules & heuristics
  - LLM/RAG reasoning
  - Historical patterns
- Produce:
  - Recommendations
  - Alerts
  - What-if scenarios
  - Actions
- Expose outputs via:
  - Dashboards
  - Chat/NLP interface
  - APIs/webhooks back into customer systems

---

### 1.5 AOS Farm – Synthetic Data & Test Environment

**What it is**  
A **synthetic but realistic enterprise environment** used to test and validate AOS without real customer data.

**Key responsibilities**

- Generates:
  - Synthetic **Assets** (apps, DBs, SaaS tenants).
  - Synthetic **Sources** (CRMs, ERPs, billing systems, DW tables).
  - Realistic **data patterns**: duplicates, schema drift, conflicts, shadow IT, etc.
- Enables:
  - Regression testing of AOD, AAM, DCL, Agents.
  - Performance and scale testing.
  - Demo environments that look and feel like real enterprise chaos.

---

## 2. Data & System Concepts

### 2.1 Asset

**Definition**  
An **Asset** is anything that **runs**:

> It has a runtime/process, can be up or down, consumes CPU/RAM/IO, and has a potential blast radius if it fails.

If it doesn't "run," it's **not** an Asset in AOD's sense.

**Examples of Assets**

- **Infrastructure**
  - VM, bare-metal host, Kubernetes node or pod, container, serverless function
  - Load balancer, API gateway, message queue, cache node (Redis, Memcached)
- **Data platforms**
  - Postgres/MySQL instance, MongoDB cluster, Oracle DB, Supabase project
  - Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift / Databricks warehouse or cluster
- **SaaS / apps**
  - Salesforce org, NetSuite instance, Slack workspace, Jira cloud instance, GitHub org
  - Running internal services / microservices / monoliths (HTTP APIs, gRPC services, etc.)
- **Pipelines & jobs**
  - Airflow / Dagster / dbt runners
  - ETL/ELT jobs, scheduled batch jobs, streaming consumers

**Examples of things that are *not* Assets**

These are **artifacts or metadata**, not runtimes:

- **Raw data**
  - CSV/Parquet files in S3/GCS/Azure Blob
  - A specific table or view definition (e.g., `dw.dim_customer`)
  - Backup files and snapshots
- **Code & configs**
  - GitHub repo, dbt model file, Terraform file, Helm chart, Docker image in a registry
- **Definitions & docs**
  - LookML file, Tableau workbook file at rest
  - Notion/Confluence pages, Figma designs, specs

> The **thing that runs** (Snowflake warehouse, Tableau server, k8s service, Salesforce tenant) is the Asset.  
> The **data, code, configs, and docs** it holds or uses are *not* Assets, even though they are important for lineage and semantics.

**Role in AOS**

- Discovered and tracked by **AOD**.
- Used for:
  - Risk scoring and shadow IT detection.
  - Understanding where Sources live.
  - Dependency / blast radius mapping.

---

### 2.2 Source

**Definition**  
A **Source** is a **logical system-of-record** for one or more **ontology entities** in DCL.

- It is about **business meaning**, not just infrastructure.
- A single Asset can back multiple Sources; a Source can span multiple Assets.

**Examples**

- `salesforce_crm` – SoR for `Account`, `Opportunity`.
- `netsuite_erp` – SoR for `Customer`, `Invoice`.
- `stripe_billing` – SoR for `Subscription`, `Charge`.
- `internal_crm_postgres` – custom CRM tables on a Postgres DB.
- `dw_dim_customer` – curated customer dimension table in a warehouse.
- `legacy_oracle_erp` – old but still authoritative system.

**Role in AOS**

- DCL reads from **Sources**, not arbitrary Assets.
- For each entity, DCL decides:
  - Which Sources serve it.
  - Which Source is **primary** vs **secondary** (lineage, cross-validation).

---

### 2.3 Source Types (Tiers)

Each Source has a **SourceType**, used to handle redundancy and warehouses:

1. **SYSTEM_OF_RECORD (SoR)**  
   Operational systems where events originate.  
   Examples: Salesforce, NetSuite, Stripe, custom CRM on Postgres.

2. **CURATED / CONFORMED**  
   Warehouse / lake / semantic outputs where entities are already cleaned and modeled.  
   Examples: `DW.dim_customer`, `DW.fact_revenue`, semantic-layer tables.

3. **AGGREGATED / DERIVED**  
   Highly aggregated structures, usually for reporting.  
   Examples: MRR by month per segment, BI extracts.

4. **CONSUMER_ONLY**  
   Tools that just read and visualize; they don't define durable entities.  
   Examples: Tableau workbooks, Looker dashboards, Power BI reports.

**DCL rule of thumb**

- DCL treats **SYSTEM_OF_RECORD** and **CURATED** as **true Sources** for entities.
- **AGGREGATED** and **CONSUMER_ONLY** are usually **Assets only**, not DCL Sources.

---

### 2.4 Ontology

**Definition**  
The **Ontology** is the formal definition of the **business entities** AOS cares about and how they relate.

**Examples of entities**

- `Account`
- `Opportunity`
- `Revenue`
- `Cost`
- `Usage`
- `Health`
- `AwsResource` (or `CloudResource`)
- `Date` / `TimePeriod`

**Elements**

- Classes/entities (e.g., `Account`).
- Properties/fields (e.g., `account_id`, `name`, `billing_country`).
- Relationships (e.g., `Account` has many `Opportunities`; `Account` generates `Revenue`).

**Role in AOS**

- Defined and owned by **DCL**.
- Drives:
  - Field mapping from Sources.
  - Entity resolution.
  - Canonical stream structure.
  - What Agents can "see" and reason about.

---

### 2.5 Canonical Entity & Canonical Stream

**Canonical Entity**  
A unified, deduplicated representation of a real-world thing (e.g., a customer) across multiple Sources.

- Example: Salesforce Account + NetSuite Customer + DW dim_customer row → **one** canonical `Account`.

**Canonical Stream**  
A time-ordered stream of canonical entities or events produced by DCL.

- Examples:
  - `AccountStream` – all Accounts, with updates over time.
  - `RevenueStream` – all revenue events, normalized across billing systems.
  - `UsageStream` – unified usage metrics across products/platforms.

**Role in AOS**

- The **only thing** that Agents and dashboards depend on.
- Decouples **upstream chaos** from **downstream intelligence**.

---

### 2.6 Lineage & Provenance

**Definition**  
The ability to trace a canonical entity or field back to the underlying Sources and Assets.

**Role**

- Explains:
  - "This MRR figure comes from `dw_fact_revenue`, which is built from Stripe + NetSuite."
  - "This Account identity is primarily from Salesforce, enriched with NetSuite fields."
- Supports:
  - Trust and explainability.
  - Debugging data issues.
  - Compliance and audits.

---

## 3. External Data Stack Components (as AOS sees them)

### 3.1 Data Warehouse / Data Lake

**Definition**  
Central platforms where enterprises store and (sometimes) model data from many systems.

**Examples**

- Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse.
- Lakes / Lakehouses: Databricks, S3 + Iceberg/Delta, GCS + BigLake.

**Role in AOS**

- Always **Assets**.
- May host **Sources** of type:
  - `CURATED` (e.g., `dim_customer`, `fact_revenue`).
  - Sometimes `SYSTEM_OF_RECORD` (for lake-native apps).
- DCL can:
  - Treat curated DW tables as the **primary Source** for an entity.
  - Or ignore them if they are not trustworthy / incomplete.

---

### 3.2 Semantic / Metrics Layer

**Definition**  
Layer that defines business metrics and dimensions on top of DW (e.g., dbt, LookML, metrics layers).

**Role in AOS**

- Represented as:
  - `CURATED` Sources when they define entity-level tables.
  - Or `AGGREGATED` if they only produce rollups.
- Used by Agents for:
  - High-level KPIs.
  - Sanity checks versus raw canonical streams.

---

### 3.3 BI / Reporting Tools

**Definition**  
Tools that visualize data and provide dashboards: Tableau, Looker, Power BI, Mode, etc.

**Role in AOS**

- Always **Assets**.
- Typically `CONSUMER_ONLY`, not Sources.
- Consumers of:
  - Canonical streams pushed to the DW.
  - Agent-generated views/metrics.

---

### 3.4 IdP (Identity Provider) & Secrets Manager (AAM Context)

**IdP**

- Examples: Okta, Entra ID (Azure AD), on-prem AD.
- Role:
  - Central identity & access provider.
  - Used by **AAM** for OAuth/OIDC, SSO, and app discovery.

**Secrets Manager**

- Examples: Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager.
- Role:
  - Stores credentials/tokens that AAM uses when IdP-based integration is not possible.

---

## 4. Human & Agent-Facing Concepts

### 4.1 Personas

**Definition**  
High-level **roles in the business** that consume information: CFO, CRO, COO, CTO, etc.

**Role in AOS**

- Each Persona has:
  - A **set of ontology entities** they primarily care about.
  - A **canonical dashboard** that surfaces these entities in their language.
  - Optional dedicated agents (FinOps, RevOps, etc.).

**Examples**

- **CFO** – `Revenue`, `Cost`, `Margin`, `Cash`, `Risk`.
- **CRO** – `Account`, `Opportunity`, `Pipeline`, `Churn`.
- **COO** – `Usage`, `Health`, `SLAs`, `Incidents`.
- **CTO** – `Assets`, `CloudResources`, `Cost`, `Risk`, `TechDebt`.

---

### 4.2 Dashboards

**Definition**  
UI surfaces that present canonical data and agent insights per Persona.

**Role in AOS**

- Read from **canonical streams** and **agent outputs**, not raw sources.
- Show:
  - KPIs, trends, anomalies.
  - Links back to underlying Sources/Assets via lineage when needed.
- Serve as:
  - "Single pane of glass" for each Persona.
  - Entry points for drilling into agent recommendations.

---

### 4.3 NLP / Chat Interface

**Definition**  
Natural-language interface to query the system and interact with agents.

**Role in AOS**

- Lets users:
  - Ask questions ("Why did revenue drop last month?").
  - Request actions ("Simulate impact of a 10% price increase in EMEA.").
- Behind the scenes:
  - Routes to the right agent(s).
  - Executes on top of canonical streams + ontology.

---

## 5. Key Distinctions for AOS Farm

### Asset vs Source

| Concept | Definition | Examples |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Asset** | Anything that **runs** (has runtime, can be up/down, consumes resources, has blast radius) | PostgreSQL instance, Salesforce org, K8s pod, Snowflake warehouse, Redis cache, API gateway |
| **Source** | Logical system-of-record for business entities | `salesforce_crm`, `internal_crm_postgres`, `dw_dim_customer` |

**What is NOT an Asset**:
- Raw data files (CSV, Parquet in S3)
- Table/view definitions (`dw.dim_customer`)
- Code/configs (GitHub repos, dbt models, Terraform files)
- Docs (Notion pages, Figma designs)

**Key insight**: The **runtime** (Snowflake warehouse, Postgres instance) is the Asset. The **data and definitions** it holds are not Assets. A database (Asset) becomes a Source when it serves as a system-of-record for business entities.

### Source Type Classification

| Type | Role | Is DCL Source? | Example |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| SYSTEM_OF_RECORD | Where events originate | Yes | Salesforce, custom Postgres CRM |
| CURATED | Cleaned/modeled warehouse tables | Yes | `dim_customer`, `fact_revenue` |
| AGGREGATED | Rollups for reporting | Usually No | MRR by segment |
| CONSUMER_ONLY | Read-only visualization | No | Tableau, Looker |
