
I'm especially curious about:

Does the core problem and solution make sense?
Is it clear from the demo what the platform does?
 

No pressure at all, but any brief feedback you have would be a huge help.  Let me know if you have a minute to chat. 

 

Best,

P.S. For a more detailed technical overview, the demo runs on AutonomOS, our new AI-native platform. We've built intelligence into every layer, from the data fabric to the agentic execution:

AI-Driven Connectivity (AAM): Our Adaptive API Mesh uses AI to proactively build and learn connectivity between systems. This isn't just a static setup; it provides autonomous drift repair and self-healing integration to ensure workflows are resilient to the constant changes in your underlying data sources and APIs.
AI-Powered Data Layer (DCL): The Data Connectivity Layer (DCL) is the core data intelligence engine. It uses AI to autonomously map disparate data sets into a Unified Enterprise Ontology. This feeds a Contextual RAG engine that continuously learns from your data, creating AI-ready streams. This process is orchestrated by our AOA engine, using an embedded DuckDB for high-performance in-memory analytics.
Autonomous Agent Execution: Our Prebuilt Domain Agents leverage this AI-prepared data fabric to execute complex, end-to-end business workflows. The system is designed with an LLM service abstraction (supporting Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) allowing agents to use the best model for the job to reason, learn, and act.
Enterprise-Grade Foundation: This all runs on a secure, scalable multi-tenant backend. The stack is built on FastAPI (with Pydantic validation) for the API, PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy for persistence, and Redis with Python RQ for robust, asynchronous task orchestration. This manages the entire task lifecycle, including automatic retries, timeouts, callbacks, and task chaining for complex workflows.
Secure by Design: The platform is fully multi-tenant, with complete data isolation enforced at the database level (tenant_id scoping). All authentication is handled via JWT with industry-standard Argon2 password hashing.
