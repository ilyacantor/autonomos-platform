Replit MAX Agent Prompt (Box Size Consistency & Responsive Tags)

🛠️ Objective:
Ensure that all the boxes (cards) in the architecture flow visualization — specifically inside AutonomOSArchitectureFlow.tsx or related containers — are:

Fixed in size (square or specific ratio, e.g., w-[220px] h-[220px]) regardless of screen zoom, screen size, or responsive scaling.

Do not distort or resize on mobile, zoomed viewports, or different resolutions.

Text tags inside each box must remain legible (minimum text-sm or scale dynamically with clamp() if needed) and must never bleed outside or overflow.

🧱 Guardrails:

Use Tailwind CSS utility classes or direct inline style={{}} if needed.

Boxes must not collapse or stretch when the screen is narrow.

On smaller screens (e.g., mobile), they should horizontally scroll or wrap underneath with proper spacing.

Each card should have min-w, min-h, and max-w, max-h set to the same value. Use aspect-square if helpful.

Set overflow-hidden + text-ellipsis + break-words to ensure internal tag layout never overflows.

Allow inner tag components to wrap inside the box, not overflow it.

Ensure zooming in (e.g., Ctrl+Plus) doesn't cause layout collapse or unexpected horizontal scroll unless explicitly intended.

🧪 Test Cases:

✅ Desktop 1080p @ 100% and 150% zoom

✅ iPhone 12 / Galaxy S9 mobile simulation (DevTools)

✅ Tablet (iPad landscape and portrait)

✅ Small laptop screens (13-inch)

📍 Target Component File:
Likely AutonomOSArchitectureFlow.tsx, or whichever renders the “Enterprise Data → AAM → DCL → Prebuilt Agents → Outcomes” boxes.

🎯 Deliverables:

✅ All four input blocks and the Outcomes box should remain perfectly square and aligned, even on resize.

✅ Tags within each card stay fully visible and neatly arranged inside the box.

✅ Mobile should trigger a layout reflow, not box collapse.

✅ No box overlap or bleeding into adjacent layout.

✅ Suggested Tailwind Examples (for dev reference)
<div className="w-[220px] h-[220px] min-w-[220px] min-h-[220px] max-w-[220px] max-h-[220px] aspect-square overflow-hidden p-2 bg-slate-800 rounded-lg flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
  <span className="text-sm text-center break-words">Some tag content</span>
  <span className="text-sm text-center break-words">Another Tag</span>
</div>


For dynamic tag lists inside each box:

<div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center items-center gap-1 mt-2">
  {tags.map((tag) => (
    <span key={tag} className="bg-slate-700 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded text-xs max-w-[90%] text-center truncate">
      {tag}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>
