Project: AutonomOS – Stage-Driven Discovery → Mesh → Mapping → Agent Demo

I want a single-page, stage-driven demo UI that clearly shows the complexity at each stage of the pipeline, not just a background spinner.

There are 4 stages, each with its own visual focus and detail panels:

AOD Discovery – asset explosion & risk

AAM Connections – API contracts & OAuth complexity

DCL Mapping – disparate schemas → unified entities

Agent Execution – query plan & result trace

The key requirement:

The main UI MUST visibly change at each stage.

Each stage highlights a different part of the graph and shows a different details panel.

Nothing should “just run in the background.”

Overall layout & style

Dark-mode enterprise console (Datadog / Grafana / Prisma Cloud vibe).

Use Quicksand for typography.

Brand colors:

Primary: cyan #0bcad9 (plus cyan-400/600 for variations)

Status: green #22c55e, blue #3b82f6, purple #a855f7, red #ef4444, orange #f97316

Neutrals: very dark slates for background (#020617–#0f172a), #0f172a–#1e293b for cards, #334155 borders

Screen split:

Top: slim app bar with logo + “AutonomOS – Discovery & Mesh Demo (Demo Tenant)” + status pills.

Center-left: graph panel.

Center-right: stage details panel that changes with the current stage.

Bottom: 4-stage stepper with “Back / Next” and a “Run full pipeline” button.

Graph panel (always visible, reacts to stage)

Nodes:

Left: vendor nodes – Salesforce, MongoDB, Supabase, Legacy Files.

Middle: AAM – Adaptive API Mesh.

Right-middle: DCL – Data Connectivity Layer.

Far-right: Agents.

Edges:

Vendor → AAM, AAM → DCL, DCL → Agents.

Behavior per stage:

Stage 1: vendor nodes glow; edges to AAM are grey/dashed; AAM/DCL/Agents slightly dimmed.

Stage 2: vendor→AAM edges animate (pulses); AAM node glows cyan/green; other edges dim.

Stage 3: AAM→DCL edge animates; DCL node glows; vendor nodes dim slightly.

Stage 4: DCL→Agents edge animates; Agent node glows; rest in background.

Use subtle animations (not crazy) to show flow direction per stage.

Stage detail panel – must change content per stage

There is a currentStage (1–4). The detail panel content should be completely different for each stage:

Stage 1 – AOD Discovery (Assets + Risk)

Title area: “AOD Discovery — Assets & Risk”

Show complexity as:

Stats: “435 assets”, “195 ready”, “180 parked”, “29 shadow / high-risk”.

A small table: columns = Asset Name, Vendor, Kind (saas/service/db/host), Environment, Risk, State.

Highlight multiple vendors in the table.

Under the table, a short explanatory block:

“Normally: spreadsheets, interviews, and guesswork to find what’s running.”

“Here: AOS uses log & config telemetry and AI classifiers to discover and risk-score assets.”

Only this content should be visible in Stage 1. No contracts, no field mappings, no agent trace.

Stage 2 – AAM Connections (API contracts + OAuth)

Title: “AAM Connections — Connectors, Contracts, OAuth”

Hide the Stage 1 asset table and instead show per-vendor connector details in a table or cards:

For Salesforce:

Auth: “OAuth2, short-lived tokens, refresh token rotation; scopes: api, refresh_token, offline_access.”

Contract: base URL, API version, key endpoints, pagination scheme, rate-limit policy.

For MongoDB:

TLS SRV conn string, credentials in vault, collections, read preference.

For Supabase:

Postgres URL, schema, RLS awareness, connection mode.

For Legacy Files:

Bucket/path, file pattern, schedule, CSV layout.

Add a small “How AOS handled this” box at the bottom:

“Connector recipes + AI over our configuration corpus choose auth flows, scopes, timeouts, and backoff policies. No manual YAML.”

When Stage 2 is active, only connector details are visible in the detail panel. No asset table, no mapping table, no agent trace.

Stage 3 – DCL Mapping (disparate schemas → unified)

Title: “DCL Mapping — Unified customer_360 Entity”

Hide connector details. Instead show:

Intro line:

“DCL builds a unified customer_360 entity from Salesforce, MongoDB, Supabase, and Legacy Files.”

A table with columns: Canonical Field, Type, Sources (vendor.fieldPath + confidence).

Entries:

customer_id (string) ← Salesforce.Account.Id · 97%, MongoDB.users._id · 93%, Supabase.customers.customer_id · 96%, Legacy.legacy_customers.customer_id · 90%

customer_name (string) ← Salesforce.Account.Name · 98%, Supabase.customers.full_name · 94%, Legacy.legacy_customers.name · 91%

arr (number) ← Salesforce.Opportunity.Amount (aggregated) · 95%, Supabase.invoices.total_amount · 90%

last_activity_at (date) ← MongoDB.events.timestamp · 95%, Salesforce.Task.LastModifiedDate · 88%

churn_flag (boolean) ← Legacy.churn_flags.flag · 99%

risk_score (number) ← e.g. MongoDB.events.error_rate · 86%, Supabase.invoices.overdue_balance · 89%

Each source should be rendered as a small chip with vendor, field path, and confidence.

At the bottom, a short explanation:

“Normally: weeks of debating IDs and joins across CRM, billing, events, and legacy exports.”

“Here: ontologies, naming heuristics, and data profiling propose canonical fields and joins with confidence scores.”

In Stage 3, you should not see connector auth details or the Stage 1 asset table. Only the field mapping view.

Stage 4 – Agent Execution (query plan + result trace)

Title: “Agent Execution — Query Plan & Result Trace”

Hide mapping table. Show:

Top: a static user question box:

“Show risky customer-facing services over $1M ARR across Salesforce, MongoDB, Supabase, and Legacy Files.”

Middle: a vertical trace list (like logs):

“Resolved question to customer_360 unified entity.”

“Selected fields: customer_id, arr, last_activity_at, churn_flag, risk_score.”

“Fetched data via AAM from Salesforce, MongoDB, Supabase, Legacy Files.”

“Applied enterprise policy HIGH_ARR_HIGH_RISK_SERVICES.”

Bottom: a compact result table:

Columns: Service / Customer / ARR / Risk Score / Why flagged.

3–5 fake rows with realistic numbers and reasons.

Tiny note at bottom:

“Agent executes over DCL’s unified view, not raw tables; no manual SQL or joins.”

In Stage 4, the detail panel is purely trace + results. No asset list, no connector details, no mapping table.

Stage navigation & animation

At the bottom of the screen, have a clear 4-step stepper labeled with the stages.

User can click each stage or use “Back/Next” to move currentStage.

When currentStage changes:

Update which node/edges in the graph animate and glow.

Swap out the entire detail panel content according to the rules above.

Do NOT leave previous-stage content visible.

There should also be a “Run full pipeline” button that auto-steps through 1→2→3→4 with short delays; each step still triggers the stage-specific UI changes.

Data & implementation constraints

All data is fake but should look realistic (IDs, scopes, URLs, field names).

Everything is front-end only: no network calls, no real OAuth.

Use React state (or Designer’s equivalent) to manage currentStage and conditional rendering.

Avoid the word “sample” anywhere in user-facing text. Use “demo tenant”, “ingested dataset”, or just “data” instead.

The key success criteria:

A person watching the demo can clearly see:

Stage 1: “So many assets, categorized and risk-scored.”

Stage 2: “API auth + contracts are gnarly, but AOS set them up.”

Stage 3: “Schemas are messy, but AOS built a clean customer_360.”

Stage 4: “The agent runs over the unified model with an auditable trace.”

Each stage feels like a different view into the same system, not just a spinner on one static screen.
