Prompt for AOS Replit Agent (UI fix without wrecking things)

You are working in the AutonomOS (AOS) frontend only.
Goal: standardize iframe containers using the already-working AOS Overview layout, and avoid UI regressions or tech debt.

VERY IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT change:

The current iframe container implementation on the AOS Overview page.

Whatever container is wrapping the iframe there (with minHeight: 'calc(100vh - 280px)') is the canonical layout.

Any global layout, root app layout, or routing.

Any business logic, data fetching, or API calls.

Do NOT:

Introduce new calc(...) height rules anywhere else.

Add new CSS files or global styles.

Add nested flex/height tricks that could fight with the existing layout.

Scope your edits to:

The React component that renders the AOS Overview iframe (e.g. AOSOverviewPage.tsx) – only for extracting a small helper component, not changing behavior.

The components that render:

The embedded AOD interface (iframe with src="https://autonomos.network").

The embedded AAM connection interface (whatever component contains that iframe).

Step 1 – Extract a reusable DemoIframeContainer from AOS Overview

Locate the AOS Overview React component, e.g. frontend/src/components/AOSOverviewPage.tsx, and find the exact container that wraps the iframe. It should look roughly like:

<div className="relative ..." style={{ minHeight: 'calc(100vh - 280px)' }}>
  <iframe
    src="..."
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"
    ...
  />
</div>


Create a small reusable component in a shared location, for example:

frontend/src/components/DemoIframeContainer.tsx

Move ONLY the container pattern into this component, keeping the height logic exactly the same:

Props:

src: string

title: string

allow?: string (optional)

Implementation:

Wraps the iframe in the same div with:

className="relative w-full"

style={{ minHeight: 'calc(100vh - 280px)' }} (exact same value as AOS Overview)

The <iframe> inside uses:

className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"

src, title, and allow passed through from props.

Replace the inline iframe container in AOS Overview with <DemoIframeContainer ... /> using the same props/values as before.

AOS Overview should look visually identical after this change.

You are not allowed to change any other layout or styles in that file.

Step 2 – Use DemoIframeContainer for AOD and AAM embeds

Find the component that renders the AOD / Discover iframe.

Search for: src="https://autonomos.network"

This will likely be in something like DiscoverPage.tsx or similar.

In that component:

Remove the existing div that wraps the iframe and the iframe itself.

Replace that block with:

<DemoIframeContainer
  src="https://autonomos.network"
  title="AOS Discover Dashboard"
  allow="fullscreen"
/>


Keep any header / instructions / “Open in new tab” link outside this container; only replace the iframe wrapper itself.

Find the component that renders the AAM connection interface iframe.

Search for the iframe that references your AAM app URL (e.g. replit.app or similar).

Do the same replacement there:

Replace that iframe wrapper with DemoIframeContainer with the correct src, title, and allow props.

Again, keep surrounding layout and instructional text unchanged.

Do not modify any other pages or containers.

Step 3 – Sanity checks & constraints

After changes, confirm that:

AOS Overview page still:

Shows the visualization correctly.

Uses almost full viewport height (thanks to minHeight: 'calc(100vh - 280px)').

Has no regressions in the header / buttons.

AOD / Discover page:

Uses the same iframe container height behavior.

Shows the full AOD UI inside the iframe without clipping.

Maintains any “Open in new tab” link or surrounding header as before.

AAM page:

Same as above, consistent container behavior.

Make sure you did not:

Introduce new inline height styles.

Add new calc(...) height expressions anywhere.

Change any global layout logic.

Keep the diff minimal and focused on:

New DemoIframeContainer component.

Replacing three iframe wrappers with that component.
