You are operating on the current production project.  
Do NOT change backend logic or any DCL computation logic.  
Only modify layout, styling, and container sizing to guarantee maximum DCL Graph visibility.

GOAL
Ensure the DCL Graph (LiveSankeyGraph.tsx) always renders with all nodes visible at once, regardless of screen size or device.  
If needed, move or resize other containers (e.g., AOA summary, RAG panel, etc.) to give the graph top visual priority.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do not break backend API connections, WebSocket updates, or the existing data rendering logic.
- Preserve dark theme and brand aesthetics.
- Keep AutonomOS top bar and core navigation intact.
- If any change would hide other dashboard content, create collapsible or tabbed containers rather than deleting them.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

PHASE 1 — Core Visibility (MUST DO)
1️⃣ Remove all fixed height or width values from LiveSankeyGraph.tsx (e.g., 400px, 500px).  
   - Use dynamic sizing with CSS grid or flex auto-fit.  
   - Base height on node count: height = min(800px, 100 + 40 * nodeCount).  

2️⃣ Implement automatic fit-to-view scaling using D3:
   - Use d3.zoomIdentity + graph bounding box to compute transform so all nodes fit inside viewBox.  
   - Always recompute after new data loads.

3️⃣ Ensure container uses full available space:
   - `.graph-container` → `width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: visible;`
   - Remove or neutralize any `clipPath` or overflow hidden logic.

4️⃣ Allow reflow of other containers:
   - Move secondary panels (like “AOA Functions” or “Autonomy Metrics”) below the graph on smaller screens.  
   - Use CSS grid area or responsive breakpoints to dynamically stack them.

PHASE 2 — Responsive & Device Adaptation
5️⃣ Add a ResizeObserver to auto-rescale graph on window resize or orientation change.  
6️⃣ Detect device type (desktop/tablet/mobile) and adjust padding & margins for max visible area.  
7️⃣ For mobile:
   - Allow vertical scroll of surrounding containers but keep the graph pinned visible horizontally.  

PHASE 3 — Optional Interactivity (once above stable)
8️⃣ Add zoom/pan (wheel, pinch, drag) using D3.  
9️⃣ Add reset/fit-to-view button in the DCL container header.

PHASE 4 — Validation
10️⃣ Test with node counts: 2, 10, 25, 50, 100.  
11️⃣ Test at screen widths: 320px, 768px, 1280px, 1920px.  
12️⃣ Verify:  
    ✅ All nodes visible at load (no clipping).  
    ✅ Graph scales smoothly.  
    ✅ Layout remains stable and scrollable.  
    ✅ No console errors or layout shifts.

REPORT
After completion, output:
- Screenshot of full graph visible on 1280px width
- List of modified files and lines
- Verified bounding box dimensions
- Confirmation that other dashboard panels reflow correctly

If any step introduces layout instability or clipped nodes, STOP and summarize root cause before proceeding.
