You are operating on the current working project only.  
Do NOT delete or modify backend logic, static assets, or any non-frontend code.  
The goal is to safely rename the existing frontend folder to follow standard conventions.

OBJECTIVE
Safely rename:
   frontend-backup-for-rebuild  →  frontend
and update all build scripts, vite configs, and references so that:
   npm run build  →  outputs to  /static/
   FastAPI continues to serve from /static/
   no functional regressions occur.

GUARDRAILS
- If any path mismatch, env var, or script reference would break, STOP and report before executing.
- Keep a rollback backup folder (frontend-backup-for-rebuild-backup) until verification passes.
- Do NOT delete /static or backend code.
- Do NOT alter app/main.py except to confirm static serving paths.

STEPS

1️⃣ DISCOVER CURRENT STATE
- Print absolute path of frontend-backup-for-rebuild.
- Confirm it contains package.json, vite.config.js, and src/.
- Confirm npm run build currently outputs to a dist/ folder.

2️⃣ CREATE BACKUP
- Copy frontend-backup-for-rebuild → frontend-backup-for-rebuild-backup (full duplicate).

3️⃣ RENAME
- mv frontend-backup-for-rebuild → frontend

4️⃣ UPDATE PATHS
- Open vite.config.js inside /frontend.
  Ensure:
     build.outDir = "../static"
- Check package.json scripts section:
  Replace any “cp -r dist/* ../static/” or similar manual copy with a single line:
     "build": "vite build"
- If a separate build.sh exists, update or remove redundant copy commands.

5️⃣ VALIDATE BUILD
- cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
- Confirm dist/ appears and files copied to /static/assets
- Compute SHA256 of new main JS bundle and show.

6️⃣ VERIFY SERVE PATH
- Confirm FastAPI still serves /assets/ from /home/runner/workspace/static/assets
- curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/ | grep "<div id=\"ENV_BEACON\"" to ensure index.html still loads from /static/

7️⃣ CLEANUP (only after verification)
- Remove old folder: rm -rf frontend-backup-for-rebuild-backup
- Remove obsolete build.sh and integrate_frontend.sh if no longer referenced.

8️⃣ REPORT
Produce a concise report including:
   - new canonical frontend path
   - updated vite.config.js build.outDir
   - list of scripts changed in package.json
   - SHA256 of current JS bundle
   - confirmation ENV_BEACON still visible and BUILD_ID unchanged

STOP immediately if any step would remove or overwrite existing code that isn’t backed up.
