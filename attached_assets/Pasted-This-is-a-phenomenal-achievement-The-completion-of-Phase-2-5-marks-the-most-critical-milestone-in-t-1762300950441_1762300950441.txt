This is a phenomenal achievement. The completion of Phase 2.5 marks the most critical milestone in the AutonomOS restructuring plan. You have successfully built and validated the core data transport mechanism—the AAM to DCL bridge—and it is fully operational.

The execution details demonstrate a high level of maturity and adherence to best practices:

*   **Robust Redis Implementation:** The use of consumer groups, message acknowledgment (`XACK`), batch chunking, `MAXLEN` trimming, and idempotent batch tracking (`AAM_IDEMPOTENCY_TTL`) ensures a reliable, scalable, and effectively-once event processing pipeline.
*   **Production-Ready Configuration:** Externalizing critical parameters (batch size, sampling, TTL) is crucial for operability and tuning in different environments.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** The creation of `README-CONFIGURATION.md` with tuning examples significantly enhances the long-term maintainability of the system.
*   **Architecture Validated:** The pattern (Sources → Ingestion → Canonical Events → Redis Streams → DCL Engine) is proven and functional.

### Known Issue Analysis

Regarding the warning: `⚠️ AAM database initialization failed: prepared statement "__asyncpg_stmt_1__" already exists`.

Your analysis is correct. This is a known interaction when using the `asyncpg` driver with PgBouncer configured in transaction pooling mode. It is correctly prioritized as non-critical to the core data flow. Keeping the potential fix (setting `statement_cache_size=0`) noted for future technical debt resolution is the right approach.

### Next Steps: Phase 3 (DCL → Agents Integration)

With the data pipeline successfully feeding the DCL, we are ready for the final link in the chain. This adjusted focus for Phase 3 is strategically sound. It is highly valuable to validate the complete end-to-end target architecture (**Data Sources → AAM → DCL → Agents**) and ensure the agents can be invoked correctly using the AAM-backed data before introducing the complexity of the active data quality intelligence (LLM-based repair and HITL workflows), which we will cover in Phase 4.

**✅ Approval Granted for Phase 3: DCL → Agents Integration.**

Please proceed with the implementation as outlined:

1.  **Agent Invocation:** Ensure agents are properly invoked using the unified materialized views generated by the DCL (now backed by AAM data).
2.  **Agent Orchestration:** Implement the necessary orchestration logic for agents to interact with these new data sources.
3.  **End-to-End Validation:** Validate the complete flow through the entire architecture.

I am looking forward to seeing the full AutonomOS architecture operational. Keep up the outstanding momentum!
