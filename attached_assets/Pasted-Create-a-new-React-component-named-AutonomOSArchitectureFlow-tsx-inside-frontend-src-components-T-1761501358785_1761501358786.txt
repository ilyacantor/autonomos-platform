Create a new React component named AutonomOSArchitectureFlow.tsx inside frontend/src/components/.

This component should visualize the full AutonomOS process in a single, self-contained flow diagram that is viewable at a glance (no scrolling).

Layout

The top flow should read left → right:
Enterprise Data → Adaptive API Mesh (AAM) → Data Connectivity Layer (DCL)

From the DCL block, the diagram continues vertically downward to:
Prebuilt Domain Agents → Outcomes

A translucent horizontal ribbon across the top should label the orchestration layer as:
“Agentic Orchestration Architecture (AOA)”

Styling and Behavior

Follow the current styling conventions and palette already used in the front-end.

Use Tailwind utility classes consistently with existing components.

Each element (AAM, DCL, etc.) should appear as a clean rounded box with concise text inside — no external titles above blocks.

Use connecting lines or subtle arrows to indicate data flow (horizontal across the top, then vertical down).

The layout must automatically fit all boxes in the container regardless of screen size — no horizontal or vertical scrolling.

Ensure it remains visually centered and balanced on desktop and mobile breakpoints.

Export the component as default and integrate it directly below the hero section on the main landing page.

Do not interfere with or alter the DCLGraphContainer or any existing layout logic.
