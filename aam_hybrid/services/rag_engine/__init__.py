# RAG Engine Service - DEPRECATED
#
# This service is deprecated and scheduled for removal.
# All methods are no-op stubs that return empty values.
# Use DCL Intelligence API directly instead.
#
# The service remains for backward compatibility but will emit
# DeprecationWarning when instantiated or methods are called.
