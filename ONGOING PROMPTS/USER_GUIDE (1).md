# NLQ User Guide

## What is NLQ?

NLQ (Natural Language Query) lets you ask business questions in plain English and get instant answers. Instead of navigating complicated reports or writing database queries, just type your question like you're asking a colleague.

---

## Getting Started

### Asking Your First Question

1. Type your question in the search bar at the top of the screen
2. Press Enter or click the search button
3. View your answer in either Galaxy View or Text View

### Example Questions You Can Ask

| What You Want to Know | How to Ask It |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Company revenue | "what's the revenue?" or just "revenue?" |
| Profit margins | "what's the margin?" or "are we profitable?" |
| Sales pipeline | "how's pipeline looking?" |
| Customer churn | "churn?" or "what's our churn rate?" |
| Team information | "who is the CEO?" or "how many employees?" |
| Key metrics overview | "2025 results" or "show me the KPIs" |

**Tip:** You don't need to use formal language. Questions like "margin?" or "churn?" work just as well as complete sentences.

## View Modes

### Galaxy View (Visual Mode)

Galaxy View shows your answer as an interactive visualization:

- **Center Node**: Your main answer appears in the middle
- **Connected Nodes**: Related metrics appear around the center
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green border = High confidence answer
  - Yellow border = Medium confidence
  - Red border = Lower confidence (may need verification)

Click on any node to explore that metric further.

### Text View (Classic Mode)

Text View shows your answer as formatted text with:

- The direct answer to your question
- Supporting details and context
- Confidence level
- Time period the data covers

### Dashboard View

For overview questions like "2025 results" or "CFO dashboard", you'll see a full dashboard with:

- Key performance indicators (KPIs) in card format
- Charts and visualizations
- Trend indicators showing if metrics are up or down

---

## Dashboard Features

### Persona Dashboards

Ask for role-specific views:

- **"CFO dashboard"** - Financial metrics (Revenue, Margins, Profitability)
- **"CRO dashboard"** - Sales metrics (Pipeline, Bookings, Win Rate)
- **"COO dashboard"** - Operations metrics (Efficiency, Headcount, NPS)
- **"CTO dashboard"** - Technology metrics (Uptime, Velocity, Deployments)

### Customizing Your Dashboard

Once a dashboard loads, you can:

1. **Move widgets**: Click and drag any card to reposition it
2. **Resize widgets**: Drag the corner of any card to make it larger or smaller
3. **Refine the view**: Use the "Refine..." box at the top to make changes

### Refining Your Dashboard

The refinement box at the top of dashboards lets you modify what you see. Try commands like:

- "Add a pipeline chart"
- "Make the revenue card bigger"
- "Show this as a bar chart instead"
- "Remove the churn metric"
- "Add last quarter comparison"

### Saving Your Dashboard

- Click **Save** to keep your customized layout
- Click **Template** to save it as a reusable template
- Click **Load** to open a previously saved dashboard

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific When Needed

While simple questions work great, adding context helps for complex queries:

- Instead of "sales?" try "Q4 sales by region"
- Instead of "growth?" try "year over year revenue growth"

### Use Quick Actions

Below the search bar, you'll see quick action buttons for common questions. Click any of these for an instant answer.

### Check the History Panel

Click the panel on the right side to see:
- **History**: All your previous questions in this session
- **Debug**: Technical details (for advanced users)

Click any history item to re-run that question.

## Understanding Your Answers

### Confidence Indicators

Every answer includes a confidence level:

- **High (Green)**: Strong match to known metrics
- **Medium (Yellow)**: Good match, may have some interpretation
- **Low (Red)**: Best guess based on available data

### Time Periods

Answers will indicate what time period the data covers (e.g., "Q4 2024", "Last 12 months", "Year to date").

### Trend Arrows

On dashboard cards:
- ↑ Green arrow = Metric is improving
- ↓ Red arrow = Metric is declining
- → Gray arrow = Metric is stable

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm not getting the answer I expected"

Try rephrasing your question with more specific terms. For example:
- Instead of "money" → "revenue" or "profit"
- Instead of "how are we doing" → "are we profitable" or "revenue growth"

### "The dashboard looks different than before"

Dashboard layouts can be customized. Click the **Reset** button to return to the default layout.

### "I want to start fresh"

Refresh the page to clear your session and start with a new query.
